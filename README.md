# üõ°Ô∏è ptrlNewbieProtection - New Player Protection for Minecraft Servers

**ptlNewbieProtection** is a lightweight plugin providing temporary protection for new players on Minecraft servers. It operates entirely in-memory, relying on server data without needing an external database.

## How It Works

- **New Players**: When a player joins for the first time, they automatically receive temporary protection to safely explore the server.
- **Returning Players**: If the player has been on the server before, no protection is applied.

This ensures new players can get started without immediate risk from other players.

## Key Features

- **In-Memory**: Efficiently runs without any database dependency.
- **Lightweight**: Minimal server impact.
- **Easy Integration**: Simple to install and use.
